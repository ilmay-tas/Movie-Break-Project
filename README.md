Implementation Stage Week1: 
-I researched how to extract data from FireBase and extracted movie data from TMDB and uploaded it to Firebase. Then we managed to pull data from Firebase.
Impelementation Stage Week2:
-Based on the data I captured, I spent time on movieRecommendation and userRecommendation methods. I also spent time on the chat and addFriends function.

Week1: We fetched movie data from TMDB API and uploaded to Firebase Realtime Database. I tried to write displayImage, loadUserName, loadMovieName methods that takes data and displays on the fxml page. 
Week2: I wrote the search methods with İlmay and display methods myself. Adding user as friend methods are also written by me which is in the guicontroller class

# Implementation Week 1:
# In the first week, I designed the user interface of the authentication page to create a visual basis for the application.
# Implementation Week 2:
# In the second week, I wrote the remaining user interfaces so that the methods implemented in the application can be seen, checked and debugged. 
# I helped the backhand part and displaying the images in the user interface.
